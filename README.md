# Responsive-Design-System

# Documentation

For this project, Assessment 1: Responsive Design System, I was forced to work towards strengthening my own front-end web design skills by designing and creating a responsive Design System. This responsive Design System will be coded on GitHub and GitHub CodeSpaces, using HTML and CSS languages.

To begin, I began planning the design and creation of this system. While planning, I knew it was best to stay away from any overly-complicated designs, keeping the final design fairly simple. Therefore, when looking for inspiration for this interactive Design System, I set out to explore multiple different websites, including a website created by Wix demonstrating multiple different website design inspirations, focusing mainly on these website’s code and responsiveness.

For my own system’s design for this project, I began the creation and coding during a University computer lab class, which involved the creation of the basic code, which will be able to be worked on later, along with the installation of all of the required and useful Extensions, including Prettier Code Formatter, Live Share, Live Server, Deploy to GitHub Pages, and Code Spell Checker.

When the basic code was created, it included most of the required design components for this project, including Headings, Paragraphs, Lists, Links, Sections, and Divisions. Images, in the form of one Creative Common image, were additionally added soon after, which covered all of the required design components for this project. Additionally, considering that the content for the Design System is irrelevant for this project, most of the added text was simple descriptions of Lorem Ipsum generated text, and then was not changed later. The majority of this code was HTML code.

After the creation of this basic code, the system was ready for me to begin expanding upon this code to create a better and well-detailed design, which included focusing on the CSS code as well as adjusting and editing the HTML code. 

The first aspect that was changed in the CSS code were the colours of the system, mainly, the background colours, along with making it so these background colours would change depending on the width of the screen the system was displayed upon. The rest of the CSS was fairly simple, with only some minor issues, and were mainly created and expanded upon with a focus on the design and look of the system. The first aspect was the Navigation Bar, this change was made for the look of this website, along with the fact that the design of the navigation bar easily adjusts depending on the size of the screen viewing the system. Then, the Section and Footer were adjusted, adding a background colour to allow them to stand out against the rest of the system, along with some padding for the design look. Then, it was the design behind the image. This was one of the tricker aspects of the system to code to work the way I wished, which included it being able to scale with the screen size, although making sure it couldn’t get scaled too large, along with making sure the image would stay in the centre of the website.

After all this, I was able to make some minor changes to the website’s design including adjustments to the HTML and CSS code, and the system was completed.

I do believe that I was able to successfully strengthen my own front-end web design skills by designing and creating a responsive Design System, and I believe my Design System successfully demonstrates these skills.
